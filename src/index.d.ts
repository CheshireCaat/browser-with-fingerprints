  /**
   * Obtain a fingerprint using the specified service key and additional options.
   *
   * You can use various options to get a fingerprint according to certain criteria, depending on your needs.
   * The main parameter that filters fingerprints is tags. With them, you can choose options for specific operating systems, browsers and devices.
   * It's very handy because you can combine several tags together and thus get fingerprints for any situation.
   *
   * Other options are also useful. For example, you can get fingerprints in which the screen sizes will be limited to the values that you specify using the `minWidth` and `minHeight` options.
   * Or, if you want to always use the latest browser versions, you can use the `minBrowserVersion` option, which will filter out fingerprints that do not match the specified criteria.
   *
   * A fingerprint is an object with many properties that will be used for emulation. By default it's stored as a `JSON` string. It's strongly not recommended to change its parameters
   * manually if you aren't sure about what you are doing, otherwise correct operation of the fingerprint and anonymity of the browser is not guaranteed.
   *
   * You don't have to use this method all the time. After receiving the fingerprint, you can safely save it to a file or database, and request it from there during the next launches.
   *
   * For more information about fingerprints, please visit [this](https://fingerprints.bablosoft.com) website.
   *
   * @remarks

   *   tags: ['Android', 'Chrome'],

   * When working with the plugin, it will be much more convenient to use the alternative `launch` method, which is defined
   * only in derived plugins (not implemented in **browser-with-fingerprints** package), which immediately launches the
   * browser, connects to it and does not require additional actions. Otherwise, you will need to connect to
   * the browser manually, as well as configuring the viewport size when opening a new window
   * (using the {@link Browser.configure} method) if a fingerprint is set.
   *
   * @remarks
   * **NOTE**: This plugin only works with the `chromium` browser, which comes bundled with the plugin.
   * You will not be able to use other engines or change the path to the browser executable.
   * If you need to use the default browsers without fingerprint spoofing, there is no point in using this method.
